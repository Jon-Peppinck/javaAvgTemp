AvgTemp.java calculates the total months, the total temperature, and the average monthyl temperature (degrees Celsius)

The program asks the user how many years they would like to record temperature for.

The user will then be asked for the average temperatures for each month of the year and this will be iterated using nested loops for each month the user enters.
